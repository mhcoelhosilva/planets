![Planets Demo](demo.gif)

Planets is an interactive solar system simulation meant for the visualization of generative music. The intention is to allow for free 3D movement in the solar system and tie interactive generation of ambient music to the motion of the spheres. This is still a work in progress but there is more to come.
